Ideas: 
1)
Some social Media App Specifically for language learning/learners. For example, I am currently learning German (actively), and Portuguese (half assed-ly). In this potential app, I would like to be able to find material on the app, that either explains some grammatical/syntactical component of the language (say adverb construction); and I'd also like to have part of it devoted to creating a community of language learners (like any other Social Media apps). Furthermore a section devoted to news channels that a user may be redirected to, in order to practice reading (pages with link references? Not sure yet). 

Apps for inspiration would be:
1) Tandem
2) HelloTalk
3) Duolingo(?)
4) Memrise ...

2) Idea for a community of book lovers. The title of the app may be Buchwurm (book worm, in German). In this app, people will be able to share posts of the books they are currently reading, with a forum dedicated to the book. There may also be a BookClub feature (to either be set to private or public, depending on the coordinator). The sharing of files, virtual books, would be facilitated in the app as well. 

What other audiences may be targeted? University Students? A Marketplace similar to Chegg?
